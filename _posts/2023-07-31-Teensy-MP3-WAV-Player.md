## Introduction
This post is about a simple MP3/WAV player that I made using a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller. The player is capable of playing MP3 and WAV files from a micro SD card. It has a simple user interface consisting of a 16x2 LCD display and a rotary encoder. The player can be controlled using the rotary encoder and the LCD display shows the current status of the player. The player also has a 3.5mm audio jack for audio output. The player is powered by a 5V power supply.
