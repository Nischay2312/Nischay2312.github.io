Hello! I'm Nischay Joshi, a budding Electrical Engineer from the University of British Columbia (UBC), with an expected graduation date in May 2025. I'm based in Vancouver, BC, and I have a deep passion for hardware and fimrware development.

I'm skilled in technical areas such as microcontrollers, digital logic design and robotics. My programming languages of choice are C++, C, Python, Assembly, and System Verilog. I'm also familiar with technologies like Git, SVN, MATLAB, Altium Designer, and Xilinx software suite such as Vivado, Vitis and Petalinux.

Currently, I'm a Firmware Development Co-op at [_TRIUMF_](https://www.triumf.ca/), where I've developed and implemented a testing procedure that has reduced the verification time of newly manufactured boards by 65%. I've also gained experience programming firmware for a Xilinx Mercury X1 board with Zynq Ultrascale FPGA.

Previously, I was an Undergraduate Research Intern at UBC's [_Molecular Mechatronics Lab_](https://mm.ece.ubc.ca/), where I assisted in testing and characterizing soft and flexible touch sensors ([link to paper (old version)](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0402763/4)) and developed firmware for reading input from different sensor configurations.

I have a knack for robotics and have been trying to develop a controller for a 6-degree-of-freedom robot arm using servo motors. I've also worked on creating a ESP32 based Audio Spectrum Analyzer.

As part of my extracurricular activities, I've been actively involved in [UBC's Uncrewed Aircraft Systems](https://www.ubcuas.com/). This year I will be co-leading the Payload subteam. I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from developing the cabin interior of an air taxi to designing an automated GPS based self-driving rover.

Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I love playing lawn tennis, table tennis, soccer and classical piano. I also (_try to_) maintain a [_YouTube channel_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoLCzD3NYxd0RpYbESqbdjg) where I showcase my electronic projects.

With a blend of strong technical knowledge and creative problem-solving skills, I'm always ready to take on the next challenging project. If you're interested in learning more about my work or discussing potential collaborations, feel free to reach out to me.
