<h2>Introduction</h2> 
This website serves as a portfolio for my projects and a place to share my thoughts. I am a student at the University of British Columbia studying Electrical Engineering. 
I am currently looking for a Spring 2024 internship, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any opportunities!
I like Embedded Systems, Robotics, Hardware Design and Signal Processing.


<h2>Navigation</h2>
To navigate through the website, you can use the navigation bar at the top of the page. The Projects category contains information about my projects.
You can also find my resume and get to know a bit more about me from the Resume and the About Me categories. Finally the Home page will bring you back to this page.

<h2>FUN</h2>
Finally here is a recording of Chopin's C Sharp Minor Nocturne that I played on the piano. I hope you enjoy it!
