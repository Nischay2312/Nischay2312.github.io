<h2>Introduction</h2> 
This website serves as a portfolio for my projects and a place to share my thoughts. I am a student at the University of British Columbia studying Electrical Engineering. 
I am currently looking for a Spring 2024 internship, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any opportunities!
I like Embedded Systems, Robotics, Hardware Design and Signal Processing.
